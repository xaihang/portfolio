                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Then her friend the bird flew out of the tree and brought a gold and silver
                    dress for her, and slippers of spangled silk; and she put them on, and followed her
                    sisters to the feast. But they did not know her,
                    she looked so fine and beautiful in her rich clothes.
                    The king's son soon came up to her, and took her by the hand and
                    danced with her and no one else; and he never left her hand,
                    but when any one else came to ask her to dance, he said, "This lady is dancing with me."
                    Thus they danced till a late hour of the night, and then she wanted to go home; and the
                    king's son said, "I shall go and take care of you to your home," for he wanted to see where
                    the beautiful maid lived...then Cinderella came and she took her clumsy shoe off, and put on the
                    golden slipper,
                    and it fitted as if it had been made for her. And when he drew near and looked at her
                    face the prince knew her, and said, "This is the right bride." Then he took Cinderella
                    on his horse and rode away. And when they came to the hazel-tree the white dove sangâ€”
                    "Prince! prince! take home thy bride,
                    For she is the true one that sits by thy side!"
