                When evening came, cinderella wished to leave, and the king's
                son was anxious to go with her, but she escaped from him so quickly

                <p>She danced till it was evening, and then she wanted to go home.
                    But the king's son said, I will go with you and bear you company,
                    for he wished to see to whom the beautiful maiden belonged.
                    She escaped from him, however, and sprang into the
                    pigeon-house. The king's son waited until her father came, and
                    then he told him that the unknown maiden had leapt into the
                    pigeon-house. The old man thought, can it be cinderella. And
                    they had to bring him an axe and a pickaxe that he might hew
                    the pigeon-house to pieces, but no one was inside it. And when they
                    got home cinderella lay in her dirty clothes among the ashes, and
                    a dim little oil-lamp was burning on the mantle-piece, for
                    cinderella had jumped quickly down from the back of the pigeon-house
                    and had run to the little hazel-tree, and there she had taken off
                    her beautiful clothes and laid them on the grave, and the bird had
                    taken them away again, and then she had seated herself in the
                    kitchen amongst the ashes in her grey gown.
                    Next day when the festival began afresh, and her parents and
                    the step-sisters had gone once more, cinderella went to the
                    hazel-tree and said -
                    shiver and quiver, my little tree,
                    silver and gold throw down over me.
                    Then the bird threw down a much more beautiful dress than on
                    the preceding day. And when cinderella appeared at the wedding
                    in this dress, every one was astonished at her beauty. The king's
                    son had waited until she came, and instantly took her by the hand
                    and danced with no one but her. </p>
